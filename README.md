# Assignment Brief

###Created a new React application using create-react-app.
Imported the required packages (react, react-bootstrap).
Created a functional component App and declared its state using the useState hook.
Defined an async function fetchUsers that fetches user data from the https://reqres.in/api/users API based on a page number passed as an argument, sets the fetched data to the component's state using the setUsers function, and toggles a loading flag using the setIsLoading function.
Rendered the component's layout using JSX, with conditional rendering based on the loading flag.
When the "Get User" button is clicked, the fetchUsers function is called with a page number of 1.
When the API response is returned, the user data is mapped to individual card components using the map function and rendered in a container with a class of cards.
If the length of the users array is greater than 0, a pagination component is rendered using the react-bootstrap Pagination component.
Added some CSS styles to the component for layout and presentation.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
